# Text_classification

This project is a text classification model developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
The model is designed to classify text data into predefined categories or labels. 

Prepare your dataset: Ensure you have a dataset in the appropriate format for text classification.

Preprocess the text data: Use preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization.

Train the model: Select the appropriate NLP model (e.g., TF-IDF, Word Embeddings) and train it on your dataset.
